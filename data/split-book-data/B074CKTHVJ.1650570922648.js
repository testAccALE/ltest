The only thing keeping him from inadvertently destroying everyone and everything around him is a dragon-forged artifact. But when the item is stolen, Omen can either give up his freedom and admit he's a monster, or find a way to rein in his chaotic psionics. </p> <p>Terrified his devastating power will kill an innocent, Omen enters into a shady deal with an undead alchemist and fights his way through the fabled, underground Night Games of the arcane city of Hex to retrieve what he has lost. </p> <p>When he inadvertently frees a talking cat, his erratic powers may be the only weapon capable of protecting this new companion from savage creatures out for feline blood. Can Omen protect the cat and the people of Hex, or will he be forever lost to darkness? </p>";
