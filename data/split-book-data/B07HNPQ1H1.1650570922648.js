window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Detective Sam Benson, a native New Yorker, is brash, opinionated, and candid. Transplanted to work on Earth's first colonized planet, he envisions a relatively peaceful job. But Benson's ruthless nature might bring it to the brink of annihilation when a series of murders occur. He suspects a non-human is responsible - an android who once shared engrams with a psychopathic human. However, the detective doesn't know other non-humans once called his new world theirs. And as Benson obsesses with making a case against the android, he is oblivious to their return and the reason why they consider machines to be their gods.</p>";
