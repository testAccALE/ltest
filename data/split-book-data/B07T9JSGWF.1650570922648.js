window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The third book in the Where the Hell is Tesla? trilogy is here!</p> <p>Listen, having kids is great, my little Gigi Collins and Pete’s daughter Hannah are sweet little fluffs of cotton candy, spun from the silk of fairy spiders who live in the clouds. But man, can they cause trouble. Seriously, you’d think a two-year-old couldn’t possibly threaten the very existence of our physical reality, but, well, you know where this is going.</p> <p>So join me and Pete, and Bobo, and of course the man himself, Nikola Tesla, on another spine-tingling, bowel-loosening thrill ride, and remember: bring your adult diapers.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> If you haven’t listened to <i>Where the Hell is Tesla?</i> and <i>Don’t Touch the Blue Stuff! </i>(Where the Hell is Tesla? Book 2), I apologize in advance, as you might get completely freaking lost. If you do, just call my apartment, if I’m not watching Gigi I’ll try to pick up the phone, and I’ll fill you in. (Assuming our physical reality still exists.)</p>";
