window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young man with no past must progress into a warrior out of legend. </b></p> <p>Cinder Shade’s life begins on a fateful afternoon at the bottom of a well where he awakens, bruised, battered, and bereft of all memory. His only understanding is a driving imperative to protect those who can’t defend themselves and become a warrior worthy of the name.&nbsp;</p> <p>He discovers within himself a peculiar gift, one in which the codes of combat are made evident and the language of steel is made clear.</p> <p>When he earns a place at a prestigious elven warrior academy, Cinder fights to enhance his knowledge and perhaps even humble the proud elves who believe no human is their equal. His hard-earned skills are put to the test when strange rumblings emanate from deep in the Dagger Mountains. Monsters out of myth emerge. And so does something far worse... An ancient god. The world believes this deity long dead, but he is very much alive. And he remembers his enemies all too well. Even if they don’t remember themselves.</p>";
