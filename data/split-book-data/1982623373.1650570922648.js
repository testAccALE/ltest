Suraan, the queen regent, is beset on all sides, her son Rahuul still too young to take the throne. As his elder sister and guardian, Adaaliâ€™s only purpose is to protect Rahuul from would-be usurpers. But dark forces are at play from within and without, and she must seek help from the most unlikely of places - or be consumed by the war of the gods that threatens to destroy the very fabric of her world.</p>";
