window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Suicide Squad</i> meets <i>Galaxy Quest</i>, in this fast-paced, laugh-out-loud novel from the author the Independent calls, \"the new Terry Pratchett.\" </b>After saving an alien race and its god from a sentient zombie virus, Cal Carver and the crew of the Dread Ship <i>Shatner</i> are feeling pretty pleased with themselves. Unfortunately, the creator of the zombie virus is out for revenge, and has recruited the galaxy's deadliest - and oldest - assassin, Lady Vajazzle, to hunt Space Team down. But when Vajazzle discovers the crew is under the protection of a wolf-like species known as the Greyx, she is forced to implement a Plan B so diabolical it threatens to plunge the entire star system into chaos. With time running out, Cal must find a way to outmaneuver and outgun the galaxy's greatest killer before she murders his friends, butchers the Greyx, and buys the whole galaxy a one-way ticket to total annihilation. </p>";
