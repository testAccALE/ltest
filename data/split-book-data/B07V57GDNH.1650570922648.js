window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A post-apocalyptic fiction by N.C. Reed.</b></p> <p>Billy Todd has always been different. Most people called him odd, and those were the nice people. Though he was born with a learning disability, Billy's parents never allowed him to consider himself disabled. Raised to be self-sufficient, Billy might not be as smart as some, but he was a lot smarter than people realized.</p> <p>When the entire world is devastated by a plague that kills over 95 percent of the population, Billy is not helpless. Believing he may be the only survivor in his town, he manages to place himself in a good position to survive alone in a new world.</p>";
