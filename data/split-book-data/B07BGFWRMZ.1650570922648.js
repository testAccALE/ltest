window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"As much as Scalzi has the scientific creativity of a Michael Crichton, he also has the procedural chops of a Stephen J. Canell to craft a whodunit with buddy-cop charm and suspects aplenty - most of them in someone else's body.\" (<i>USA Today</i>) </p> <p>John Scalzi returns with <i>Head On</i>, the stand-alone follow-up to the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling and critically acclaimed <i>Lock In</i>. Chilling near-future SF with the thrills of a gritty cop procedural, <i>Head On</i> brings Scalzi's trademark snappy dialogue and technological speculation to the future world of sports. </p> <p>Hilketa is a frenetic and violent pastime where players attack each other with swords and hammers. The main goal of the game: obtain your opponent's head and carry it through the goalposts. With flesh and bone bodies, a sport like this would be impossible. But all the players are \"threeps\", robot-like bodies controlled by people with Haden's Syndrome, so anything goes. No one gets hurt, but the brutality is real, and the crowds love it. </p> <p>Until a star athlete drops dead on the playing field. </p> <p>Is it an accident or murder? FBI agents and Haden-related crime investigators Chris Shane and Leslie Vann are called in to uncover the truth - and in doing so travel to the darker side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost and where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field. </p>";
