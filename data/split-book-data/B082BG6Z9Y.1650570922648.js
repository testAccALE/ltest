Is it possible for a vampire, who has done unspeakable deeds, to change his inherent nature enough to go to Heaven once he takes the big sleep?</p> <p>As if by divine intervention, our witty anti-hero stumbles across his potential salvation in the form of Father Thomes Philseep. Only problem is the holy man has been battling evil entities, like John, his entire life.</p> <p>Can a preternatural being convince a warrior of the Light to help him cleanse his soiled soul - or does an eternity in the abyss of Hell await the abomination? Most importantly, did he leave the oven on?</p>";
