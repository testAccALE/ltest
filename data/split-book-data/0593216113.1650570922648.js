Hamilton and author William McCaskey.</b></p> <p>A child’s wish for her father comes true. The end of the world has never been so much fun. Conquering personal demons becomes all too real.

Hamilton and William McCaskey are joined by Kevin J. Anderson, Griffin Barber, Patricia Briggs, Larry Correia, Kacey Ezell, Monalisa Foster, Robert E. Hampson, John G. Hartness, Jonathan Maberry, L.
