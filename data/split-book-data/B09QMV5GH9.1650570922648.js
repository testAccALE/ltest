window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At the end of his life, Charles was left with one question: What was it all for?&nbsp;</p> <p>After his tour of duty and an unremarkable post-Army business career, Charles spent his twilight years watching old movies and waiting for his grandkids to call. He'd lived a good life and been a decent man, but now that his wife was gone, he was...lonely.</p> <p>Until his old friend Bert introduced him to <i>Crossroads</i>, the new VR sensation. In this virtual world he can move without pain, explore new lands, and most importantly - see his family again. For as long as he can hold their interest, in this fast-paced modern world of instant gratification and VR thrills.&nbsp;</p> <p>The solution: Build a place his family wants to visit. Armed only with a magic stick with game-breaking powers that should be nerfed, Charles sets out on a journey to find a place to call his own. Along the way, he will be mistaken for an NPC quest giver, become the antagonist in epic questlines, and attempt to teach the next generation proper behavior - even if he has to beat it into them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the story of one man's search for belonging in his second virtual life. A search for a place to belong, and what it takes to get there. It's also a hilarious romp through online fantasy clich√©s that will appeal to fans of <i>Ready Player One</i>, <i>The Wandering Inn</i>, and slice-of-life comedies.</p> <p>Because at the end of a man's life, what's more important than family?</p>";
