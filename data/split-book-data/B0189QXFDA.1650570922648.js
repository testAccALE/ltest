window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This audiobook includes a wonderful dedication to the long-time narrator of the series, Lorelei King, read by the author. </b></p> <p><b>Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back in the ninth installment of Darynda Jones' </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling paranormal series, </b><b><i>The Dirt on Ninth Grave</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a small village in New York Charley Davidson is living as Jane Doe, a girl with no memory of who she is or where she came from. So when she is working at a diner and slowly begins to realize she can see dead people, she's more than a little taken aback. Stranger still are the people entering her life. They seem to know things about her. Things they hide with lies and half-truths. Soon, she senses something far darker. A force that wants to cause her harm, she is sure of it. Her saving grace comes in the form of a new friend she feels she can confide in and the fry cook, a devastatingly handsome man whose smile is breathtaking and touch is scalding. He stays close, and she almost feels safe with him around.&nbsp;</p> <p>But no one can outrun their past, and the more lies that swirl around her - even from her new and trusted friends - the more disoriented she becomes, until she is confronted by a man who claims to have been sent to kill her. Sent by the darkest force in the universe. A force that absolutely will not stop until she is dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thankfully, she has a Rottweiler. But that doesn't help in her quest to find her identity and recover what she's lost. That will take all her courage and a touch of the power she feels flowing like electricity through her veins. She almost feels sorry for him. The devil in blue jeans. The disarming fry cook who lies with every breath he takes. She will get to the bottom of what he knows if it kills her. Or him. Either way.&nbsp;</p>";
