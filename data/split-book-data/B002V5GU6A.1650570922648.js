window.bookSummaryJSON = "Drawing on his own war experiences, Vietnam veteran Joe Haldeman creates stunning works of science fiction. <i>Forever Peace</i> is not a sequel to his previous award-winning work, <i>The Forever War</i>, but it deals with similarly provocative issues. When it was published, <i>Forever Peace</i> was chosen as the Best Book of the Year by <i>Publishers Weekly</i>. It also won the coveted Hugo Award. <p> War in the 21st century is fought by \"soldierboys\". Remote-controlled mechanical monsters, they are run by human soldiers who hard-wire their brains together to form each unit. Julian is one of these dedicated soldiers, until he inadvertently kills a young boy. Now he struggles to understand how this has changed his mind.</p> <p> <i>Forever Peace</i> is a riveting portrayal of the effects of collective consciousness, and it offers some tantalizing revelations. Narrator George Wilson's skillful performance weaves together the elements of futuristic technology with the drama of a trained soldier reconciling basic human needs.</p>";
