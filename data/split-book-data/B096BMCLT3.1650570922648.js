Now imagine they have just discovered a third world.</p> <p>Our world.</p> <p>Our timeline of rideshare apps and strip malls is about to become the newest battlefield in the long war between science fiction and fantasy.</p> <p>In Florida, assassins are hunting down optical scientist Felicia Scurry. Her only chance of survival lies with long haul trucker Bucephalus Troy, who has stumbled into a world he calls Bamalot, a swords and sorcery version of today where magic works and science never happened. In Seattle, YouTube blogger Charity Kong is on the trail of a jetpack-wearing secret agent who broke her heart. And in a sinister secret college deep under Oxford, a failed comic book artist just might have started a Three Worlds War.</p> <p>Legendary science fiction writer Neal Stephenson teams up with World Fantasy Award-winning author Sean Stewart (<i>Galveston</i>; <i>Cathy’s Book</i>) and Austin Grossman (<i>Soon I Will Be Invincible</i>) to present <i>New Found Land: The Long Haul</i>, a thrilling, hilarious, and mind-bending audio drama in the tradition of <i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i>.
