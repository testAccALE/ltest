He'll encounter filthy bandits, musty crypts, and friendly werewolves. Oh, you heard us right.</p> <p>If only he wasn't given negative charisma points around women, he might have a chance, but you can't win them all.</p> <p>When the only way out of the game may be through, you fight like your life depends on it.
