window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Manhattan has many secrets. Some are older than the city itself.</b> </p> <p>The city sleeps. Selene DiSilva walks her dog along the banks of the Hudson. She is alone - just the way she likes it. She doesn't believe in friends, and she doesn't speak to her family. Most of them are simply too dangerous. </p> <p>In the predawn calm, Selene finds the body of a young woman washed ashore, gruesomely mutilated and wreathed in laurel. Her ancient rage returns. And so does the memory of a promise she made long ago - when her name was Artemis. </p>";
