Amidst betrayals, bargains, and battles, four young people find their fates forever intertwined: </p> <p>Cleo: A princess raised in luxury must embark on a rough and treacherous journey into enemy territory in search of a magic long thought extinct. </p> <p>Jonas: Enraged at injustice, a rebel lashes out against the forces of oppression that have kept his country impoverished - and finds himself the leader of a people's revolution centuries in the making. </p> <p>Lucia: A girl adopted at birth into a royal family discovers the truth about her past - and the supernatural legacy she is destined to wield. </p> <p>Magnus: Bred for aggression and trained to conquer, a firstborn son begins to realize that the heart can be more lethal than the sword.... </p> <p>The only outcome that's certain is that kingdoms will fall. Who will emerge triumphant when all they know has collapsed?</p>";
