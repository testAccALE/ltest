window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'd been gone for a year, incarcerated in a hidden prison. The verdict was guilty; the punishment, death. </p> <p>Invoking the Law, I've got my freedom until my sentence is carried out. Three days, then I'm history. Gone, not even a memory. Wiped from the collective consciousness of those that knew, even loved me. </p> <p>Magic drives me on as I try to right so many wrongs committed in the name of justice. The vamps are mad, everyone's acting weird, I've got to clear my name, and nobody seems to believe I don't know what to do. Panic makes me act irrationally as the hours slip away and I become increasingly frantic. </p> <p>If it wasn't for Kate, and the need to help my nearest and dearest, I'd have let the Council put me out of my misery. But I'm alive, and I uncover information that ensures I'll do whatever it takes to remain that way. I just have to avoid getting crushed, bitten, beaten, eaten, or zapped with the dark arts. </p> <p>I should have stayed in prison. At least in there nobody tried to stomp me. </p>";
