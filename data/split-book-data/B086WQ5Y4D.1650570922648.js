Wrapped in an armored battlesuit, Cam finds purpose amidst the horror and destruction of the war, and the opportunity for a new sort of friends and family...if he can break the habits of a life spent alone, trusting no one.</p> <p>And, if he can survive....</p> <p><b>Rick Partlow returns with another kickass military sci-fi epic. It's perfect for&nbsp;fans of Jay Allan, Jasper T. Scott, and Scott Bartlett.</b></p>";
